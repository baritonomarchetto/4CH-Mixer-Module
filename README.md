This repository hosts my new eurorack mixer modules and an old mixer module, for reference only. New mixers files are stored in "VERSION_2" folder.

# 4CH-Audio/CV-Mixer-Modules
Two different mixers for two different tasks. For modular synthesizers.

1 - Four channels audio mixer module with built-in reference tone generator

2 - Four channels CV mixer module with gain compensation.

# Intro
This follows a previous mixer project I rolled out some time ago for my DIY eurorack synthesizer. 
After years of use and some time spent on the theory, I ended up seeing more clearly the limits of that project and matured some awareness on mixers.
Mixer design cannot lie out of it's final use. Will the mixer be used for audio signal or control voltage signal? Is that audio signal "hot", like the eurorack standard calls for, or "line" level?

This is why I realized two mixers: a simpler one, for audio signal processing, and another one for CV signals processing.

This repository hosts my new eurorack mixer modules and an old mixer module, for reference only. New mixers files are stored in "VERSION_2" folder.

# 4CH-Audio/CV-Mixer-Modules
Two different mixers for two different tasks. For modular synthesizers.

1 - Four channels audio mixer module with built-in reference tone generator

2 - Four channels CV mixer module with gain compensation.

# Intro
This follows a previous mixer project I rolled out some time ago for my DIY eurorack synthesizer. 
After years of use and some time spent on the theory, I ended up seeing more clearly the limits of that project and matured some awareness on mixers.

Mixer design cannot lie out of it's final use. Will the mixer be used for audio signal or control voltage signal? Is that audio signal "hot", like the eurorack standard calls for, or "line" level?

We are dealing with two mixer modules here, designed with very different applications in mind: one for audio, the other for control voltages.

The audio mixer circuit is simpler, use a small amount of components and I was able to lay the whole circuit down onto a single PCB (main board).
The full audio mixer module calls for the aforementioned main board and a front panel PCB with no components at all.

The CV mixer module is instead made of three PCBs: main board (the one with main circuitry), front board (the one hosting potentiometers and jacks) and a front panel.
Again, the CV mixer module front panel has no components.

# Mixers in Modular World
Eurorack synthesizers are modular systems renowned for their flexibility and deep sound design capabilities. Mixers are among the essential modules, and play a critical role in combining and routing signals.

Broadly speaking, mixers can be divided into two categories: audio mixers and control voltage mixers. Though their names suggest similar functions, they serve very distinct purposes in modular synthesis.

## Audio mixers

Audio mixers are designed specifically for combining audio signals. 

These signals are typically in the audible frequency range (20 Hz to 20 kHz) and are generated by oscillators, samplers, and other audio-producing sources.

Audio mixers are commonly used to combine multiple oscillators to create thick, harmonically rich sounds, sum signals processed through different effects chains, modify the audio level and balance for the final output, and so on.

In eurorack world audio signals are HOT (up to 10Vpp) and need some attenuation before hitting external hardware. Just to cite a very applicable example: "line" level, the most common input level for main mixers, is 10 times lower than eurorack.

The need for lowering the Eurorack audio level, sooner or later, makes not that important if the modular mixer "accidentally" modifies the incoming signal amplitude, in example adopting the cheap strategy of series current limiting resistors for protection pourpouses.

To our ears, a change in amplitude makes it quieter, but doesn't change the timbre or other quality aspects of the audio signal.

Another aspect strictly related to audio, underlies in the human auditory system. This responds logarithmically to changes in sound intensity, this means that potentiometers to be used in audio mixers should be logaritmic (often indicated as "A") for a "correct" behaviour.

## CV Mixers

Control voltage mixers are intended to mix modulation sources signals. These are not audible sounds, but rather signals to control module's parameters such as pitch, filter cutoff, amplitude, etc.

One of the most common use case is the mixing of expression voltages like aftertouch, velocity and keyboard tracking, but also LFOs, envelopes, and other modulation sources to create complex CV patterns.

These mixers need precision and stability over output voltage, and are more complex to design than audio processing mixers.

Precision and stability requirements are especially necessary for VCOs pitch control, being the most demanding application in synthesizers.

With such a target application in mind, simple, common solutions used in audio mixers are no longer applicable.

Just to cite an example, using series current limiting resistors for output protection could be ok if the output is used for modulation of a filter opening or an oscillator PWM duty cycle, but definitely not to control a VCO pitch over a wide octaves range because of the voltage drop it could cause.
